# 1.摘要（ABSTRACT）
本文为实现自动驾驶系统，设计并实施了三个核心功能：自动行车、避障以及红绿灯识别，并最终将这三种功能进行分级合并。系统设计阶段，结合硬件环境，主要设计了智能车行驶、数据采集及模型部署系统。数据采集系统获取相机标定板数据以及行驶信息。经过深度处理，运用计算机视觉算法，处理得到可供模型训练的数据。自动行车系统的设计采用了两种深度学习模型和两种训练任务进行模型训练，并在比较分析的基础上，结合实际运行环境，优化训练结果。避障系统借助激光雷达扫描环境数据，确定车辆四个方向范围，并根据计算结果，指导智能车避障。红绿灯识别系统在新色彩空间下划分颜色区间并提取信号灯发光部分，进一步识别颜色，根据识别颜色控制车辆行动。将上述三种功能在已实现的情况下进行整合，设计功能优先级划分，根据实际硬件环境设计单独功能的运行逻辑。并根据最终设计的结果进行智能车实际部署以实现自动驾驶功能。

(In order to realize the auto drive system, this paper designs and implements three core functions: automatic driving, obstacle avoidance and traffic light recognition. Finally, these three functions are classified and combined. In the system design phase, combined with the hardware environment, the intelligent vehicle driving, data collection, and model deployment system were mainly designed. The data acquisition system obtains camera calibration board data and driving information. After deep processing, computer vision algorithms are used to obtain data that can be used for model training. The design of the automatic driving system adopts two deep learning models and two training tasks for model training, and optimizes the training results based on comparative analysis and actual operating environment. The obstacle avoidance system uses LiDAR to scan environmental data, determine the four directional ranges of the vehicle, and guide intelligent vehicles in obstacle avoidance based on the calculation results. The traffic light recognition system divides color intervals in the new color space and extracts the illuminated parts of the signal lights, further identifying colors and controlling vehicle movement based on the identified colors. Integrate the above three functions in the already implemented situation, design priority division of functions, and design the operation logic of individual functions based on the actual hardware environment. And based on the final design results, deploy the intelligent vehicle to achieve autonomous driving function.)

## 3.1 场景平台的搭建(Construction of Scene Platform)
为了实现自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性，大量的数据收集和测试是必不可少的。然而，在真实道路上进行数据收集和测试存在一些问题，例如高昂的成本、时间限制、安全风险等。因此，建立自动驾驶模拟环境成为了一种有效的解决方案。自动驾驶模拟环境是通过仿真技术来模拟现实世界中的各种场景和情况，以进行自动驾驶系统的开发和测试。在这个模拟环境中，可以利用虚拟的道路网络、车辆模型和传感器模拟真实道路上的交通情况。通过收集和分析模拟环境中的数据，可以评估自动驾驶系统在不同情况下的性能和稳定性。首先，进行自动驾驶模拟环境道路的设计，实现基本的道路行驶，智能车根据当前路况做出前进，后退，左转与右转动作



(In order to achieve the safety and reliability of autonomous driving, extensive data collection and testing are essential. However, there are some issues with data collection and testing on real roads, such as high costs, time constraints, safety risks, etc. Therefore, establishing an autonomous driving simulation environment has become an effective solution. The automatic driving simulation environment simulates various scenes and situations in the real world through simulation technology to develop and test the auto drive system. In this simulation environment, virtual road networks, vehicle models, and sensors can be used to simulate traffic conditions on real roads. By collecting and analyzing the data in the simulation environment, the performance and stability of the auto drive system in different situations can be evaluated.Firstly, the design of an autonomous driving simulation environment road is carried out to achieve basic road driving. The intelligent vehicle makes forward, backward, left turn, and right turn actions based on the current road conditions.)

(The designed autonomous driving simulation environment performs lane design on a rectangle with a width of 420 centimeters and a length of 460 centimeters. In order to further ensure the road conditions involved in simulating actual driving situations, the designed lane width is 35 centimeters, corresponding to 1.5 times the width of the vehicle body. And run in counterclockwise order starting from the two black marked points. There are a total of 6 right angle bends, 1 turn back bend, 2 corner bends, and 7 straight paths.)

## 3.2 智能车平台(Intelligent car platform)
自动驾驶智能车平台的搭建基于幻宇自研的一款配有麦克纳姆轮的四驱遥控车，其上安装的硬件系统结构如图11所示。其中主板选用NVIDIA Jetson B01开发版，该开发版采用ARM架构。搭载了四核心Cortex-A57处理器，具有128核Maxwell GPU及4GB LPCDDR内存。支持多种AI框架与算法，兼顾了小体型和大算力。下控制器选用幻宇自研主板，负责以串口通信的方式接收上方主板信号，并以PWM波的形式通过主板芯片传递给下游的四个编码电机，借此控制智能车底盘运动。直流12V编码驱动电机为智能车运行提供强大驱动力。对于感知模块，考虑到后期数据集所需数据的形式，通过使用板载的传感器方案，其中包括一个奥比中光所研发的具有感知景深的双目摄像头和一个用于辅助矫正的自带IMU以及思岚 A1 激光雷达。传感模块可给出车身纵向速度和角速度并将这两种状态量传递给主板。传感器模块可以做到10HZ的测量频率。其中12V锂电池通过下主板对上主板进行供电，电机主要由下主板的供电端口进行12V供电。车辆控制算法的软件编写基于ROS系统，其中车辆控制端主要通过geometry_msgs功能包和sensor_msgs功能包。控制模块的运算频率设定为10Hz。即在实际过程中智能车对前方路况的判断并做出行动的时间可以控制在100ms内，体现出自动驾驶算法的实时性。



(The construction of the autonomous driving intelligent car platform is based on a four-wheel drive remote control car equipped with Mecanum wheels developed by Huanyu. The hardware system structure installed on it is shown in Figure 11. The motherboard uses NVIDIA Jetson B01 development version, which adopts ARM architecture. Equipped with a quad core Cortex-A57 processor, featuring a 128 core Maxwell GPU and 4GB LPCDDR memory. Supports multiple AI frameworks and algorithms, balancing small size and high computing power. The lower controller uses a self-developed motherboard from Huanyu, which is responsible for receiving signals from the upper motherboard through serial communication and transmitting them in the form of PWM waves to the four encoding motors downstream through the motherboard chip, thereby controlling the motion of the intelligent vehicle chassis. The DC 12V encoded drive motor provides powerful driving force for the operation of intelligent vehicles. For the perception module, considering the form of data required for the later dataset, an onboard sensor scheme is used, which includes a binocular camera with perception depth developed by Obi Zhongguang, a built-in IMU for auxiliary correction, and a Silan A1 laser radar. The sensing module can provide the longitudinal velocity and angular velocity of the vehicle body and transmit these two state variables to the motherboard. The sensor module can achieve a measurement frequency of 10Hz. The 12V lithium battery supplies power to the upper motherboard through the lower motherboard, while the motor is mainly powered by the 12V port on the lower motherboard. The software development of the vehicle control algorithm is based on the ROS system, where the vehicle control end mainly uses the geometriy_msgs and sensor-msgs function packages. The operating frequency of the control module is set to 10Hz. In the actual process, the time for intelligent vehicles to judge and take action on the road conditions ahead can be controlled within 100ms, reflecting the real-time performance of autonomous driving algorithms.)
